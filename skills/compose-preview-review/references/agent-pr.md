# Agent-authored PRs: authoring and reviewing

Guidance for two related tasks: writing a PR body when you (the agent) opened
the PR, and reviewing a PR opened by another agent.

## Authoring an Agent PR (body structure)

A reviewer opening an agent-authored PR should see **the goal** before they
see **what the agent did**. Structure the PR body in two sections, in this
order:

### 1. Goal — the user's prompt, lightly reworded

Paste the prompt that kicked off the work, cleaned up but **not rewritten**:

- Fix typos, expand pronouns that only make sense in chat ("it", "this"),
  resolve references to earlier turns ("like we discussed" → the actual
  constraint), strip conversational filler ("please", "can you").
- Keep the user's voice, scope, and emphasis. Don't add justifications,
  don't soften "must" into "should", don't invent acceptance criteria the
  user didn't state.
- One short paragraph, or a bulleted list if the user's prompt already had
  bullets. Not a re-specification.

This section anchors the review: every change the agent made should trace
back to something here. If the diff does something this section doesn't ask
for, that's a scope-creep flag for the reviewer.

### 2. Summary — what the agent actually did

Separate subsection (`## Summary` or `## What changed`) covering, in order:

- **Changes made** — one bullet per distinct change, file-path-anchored.
- **Things tried and abandoned** — approaches the agent rejected and why,
  so the reviewer doesn't suggest them again.
- **Known gaps** — anything from the goal the agent didn't do (and why:
  out of scope, blocked, unclear). Explicit gaps beat silent omissions.
- **Verification** — how the agent checked the change. For UI work, list
  the `@Preview` ids that were re-rendered and read, not just "tested
  locally".

Keep each bullet under ~2 lines. Reviewers skim; a 40-line wall-of-summary
defeats the point.

If a CI preview comment will be posted, don't duplicate the before/after in
the body — link to the comment instead. The body stays intent-focused; the
sticky comment carries the visuals.

## Reviewing a PR (agent workflow)

When asked to review a PR — especially one opened by another agent — your job
is to make the UI change legible to a *human* reviewer, not to re-do the
agent's work. Check `.github/workflows/` for preview-diff CI before
rendering (see
[ci-agent-sessions.md § Discover the repo's preview CI](./ci-agent-sessions.md#discover-the-repos-preview-ci-before-rendering-anything));
when none exists, assume you're rendering locally and that the human who
invoked you is the primary audience. If you're running *inside* a
mention-triggered CI session (`claude.yml` on an Actions runner), several
defaults below change — read
[ci-agent-sessions.md](./ci-agent-sessions.md) first.

### 1. Render base and head locally

Use a worktree for the base so the agent's working copy stays on the PR head:

```bash
BASE=$(gh pr view <N> --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName)
git worktree add ../_pr_base "origin/$BASE"

(cd ../_pr_base && compose-preview show --json) > base.json
compose-preview show --json > head.json

git worktree remove ../_pr_base
```

Diff by preview `id` + `sha256`. Bucket into **changed**, **new**, and
**removed**. Read the PNGs for each entry in `changed` and `new` directly
from the paths in the JSON — this is what the human invoking you will read
too.

### 2. Default: show the human the diffs inline, post a text comment

Without pre-existing image hosting, the simplest flow is:

1. **Read** the before/after PNGs yourself — you now have the visual context.
2. **Summarise** the deltas in plain text for the human running the review
   (per-preview: what changed, what to look for).
3. **Post a text-only review comment** to the PR. Include preview ids,
   `sha256` (first 8 chars), and the local path so the human — or a later
   agent — can reproduce:

   ```
   ## Preview diff (rendered locally, not hosted)

   **3 changed, 1 new, 0 removed** · base `origin/main@abc1234`

   ### Changed
   - `home:HomeScreen_dark` — bg #1a1a → #0d0d0d, divider gained 1dp radius
     · sha `a1b2c3d4` → `e5f6a7b8`
   - `home:HomeScreen_fontscale_1.3` — CTA wraps to 2 lines at 1.3×
     · sha `11223344` → `99aabbcc` — **likely regression, flag**

   ### New
   - `home:HomeScreen_empty` — ➕ no baseline; verify this is intentional
     · sha `deadbeef`

   _Images not uploaded. Run `compose-preview show --filter HomeScreen --json`
   locally to reproduce._
   ```

   This is far better than silence and doesn't require any infrastructure.

### 3. Uploading images — only with explicit consent

If the human asks for images in the comment, confirm the destination
before acting. One command covers both destinations:

```
compose-preview share-preview <markdown> [image]... | <dir>
    [--mechanism auto|gist|branch] [--public|--secret] [--desc TEXT]
    [--branch BRANCH] [--remote REMOTE] [--raw-base URL] [--pr-number N]
    [--message MSG] [--allow-non-preview-branch] [--json]
```

It is also reachable as `compose-preview share share-preview`.

**`--mechanism auto` (the default) picks by what the environment can
do**, so you rarely set it: when `gh` is installed *and* authenticated it
uploads a **gist**; when it isn't — Claude Code's hosted web sessions have
no `gh` and no token, but do have an authenticated git remote — it falls
back to pushing a **branch** through that remote. Force one with
`--mechanism gist|branch` when the choice matters to the human.

Two input shapes:

- **report** — `<markdown> <image>...`, a markdown file plus its image
  attachments. Works with either mechanism. Reference images by basename
  inside the markdown (`![](before.png)`); the command does not rewrite
  paths.
- **bulk** — a single `<dir>` of PNGs. Branch mechanism only (a directory
  of binaries isn't a gist). Mirrors what the `apply` action pushes in CI.

Per-mechanism things worth knowing before you run it:

- **Gist.** Default visibility is `--secret`. Even secret gist URLs are
  shareable, so still ask before pasting one into a public PR comment, and
  only pass `--public` on explicit request.
- **Branch.** The destination is derived from the branch you are on
  (`compose-preview/share/<branch>`), so each feature/PR branch's snapshots
  stay separate; `--branch` overrides, and mainline/release branches are
  refused as a target. Pushes are **SHA-pinned** — the raw URLs reference
  the new commit, so they keep resolving after the capture branch moves or
  the PR merges. Branch names must match the preview allowlist by default;
  `--allow-non-preview-branch` opts into a custom name.

`--json` emits a machine-readable envelope for either mechanism. The CLI
does **not** auto-detect prior consent — it just runs the upload.

Issue/PR **attachment** upload is not reliably available via `gh`; skip it.

Never use inline base64 or data URIs — GitHub strips them. Never push images
to a public branch, gist, or external host without the user explicitly
saying yes in the chat.

### 4. Write the comment for a human, not a log file

Whether or not there are images, the review comment is what the reviewer
will actually read. Optimise for scanning:

- **Lead with a one-line count**: `N changed · N new · N removed ·
  N unchanged` (per module if >1 module is touched). Reviewers decide
  whether to expand based on this line.
- **Only show deltas.** Unchanged previews go behind a collapsed `<details>`
  or get omitted entirely. Never post a wall of identical thumbnails.
- **Separate new/removed from changed.** New previews have no baseline and
  are easy to miss in a before/after layout — give them their own section
  with a ➕ marker. Same for removed (🗑️).
- **Side-by-side tables for changed** (when images are hosted): two-column
  markdown table, Before | After, identical widths, preview id as the row
  heading linked to the `@Preview` source line
  (`<repo>/blob/<sha>/<path>#L<line>`).
- **Group by module** and collapse with `<details><summary>` when there are
  more than ~5 previews in a bucket. First group expanded, rest collapsed.
- **Flag a11y regressions separately.** Diff
  `dataExtensions["a11y"].payload.findings[]` against the base; a finding new
  on this PR is worth a 🔴 callout even if the PNG diff is cosmetic. Link the
  `annotatedPath` PNG (or include its local path if no hosting).
- **Caption with `sha256` (first 8 chars) and byte size** under each image.
  Lets the reviewer confirm what they're looking at matches the manifest.
- **Respect the 65 536-char comment limit.** If the body would overflow,
  split into summary + per-module detail comments.
- **Don't editorialise the UI.** Describe *what* changed ("button radius
  4 → 12 dp, new ripple on press"), not whether it looks good — let the
  human make the aesthetic call.

### 5. Things worth flagging in the review text

Agent-authored PRs have predictable failure modes that the preview diff
surfaces:

- **New preview with no baseline → is it a real new surface, or did a rename
  strand an old id?** Check `removed` for a plausible predecessor.
- **Preview unchanged but source changed** → the composable may be guarded
  behind a param default the preview doesn't exercise. Ask for a preview
  variant that hits the new path.
- **A11y findings grew** → often a regression from hard-coded colours,
  missing `contentDescription`, or touch targets shrunk to match a redesign.
- **Preview changed but the PR doesn't touch its source** → suspect an
  unstable preview (clock, randomness, animation frame, network image)
  rather than a regression. Triage with [stability.md](./stability.md):
  render twice on the same commit; if the hashes differ run-to-run, say
  so in the review and propose the stabilizing fixture fix.
- **Scroll/animation flakes** in `captures[]` — if `changed: true` toggles
  run-to-run without code changes, the preview is non-deterministic; flag
  it rather than rubber-stamp the diff ([stability.md](./stability.md)
  has the full cause/fix table).

### 6. Optional: integrate with `apply` CI in `comment` mode (rare)

A small number of repos wire up the unified `apply` GitHub Action
(see the [compose-preview-ci skill](../../compose-preview-ci/SKILL.md)). On pull requests it runs in
`comment` mode and posts a sticky comment keyed by
`<!-- preview-diff -->` with before/after images hosted on a shared
`compose-preview/pr` branch, pinned to commit SHAs so they survive
merge. (If you find a project still wired to the legacy
`preview-comment` / `preview-baselines` / `a11y-report` /
`notification-previews` actions, proactively migrate it to `apply` —
the shims are scheduled for removal after one release.)

Only do this if you've already confirmed it exists:

```bash
gh pr view <N> --json comments \
  --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | startswith("<!-- preview-diff -->")) | .body'
```

If it's there, **read it first** and cite it in your review rather than
rendering again. If you do post your own comment alongside it, reuse the
`<!-- preview-diff -->` marker (or a distinct one like
`<!-- preview-diff-local -->`) so repeat reviews update one comment instead
of stacking:

```bash
MARKER="<!-- preview-diff-local -->"
ID=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/$PR/comments" --paginate \
  --jq ".[] | select(.body | startswith(\"$MARKER\")) | .id" | head -1)
if [ -n "$ID" ]; then
  gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/comments/$ID" -X PATCH -f body="$BODY"
else
  gh pr comment "$PR" --body "$BODY"
fi
```

Assume this path is **not** available unless you've just checked.
